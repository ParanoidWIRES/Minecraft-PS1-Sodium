# Who, what and why?
This mod pack was made by SeFort (Creator of the ParanoidWIRES team).
The very first version was made on GitHub and was archived on April 10.
The build was created just for fun, I (SeFort) was just sitting with Russian-speaking streamers and thought, "why not make an assembly on ps1 graphics?"

# How is it different from the old version?
The mod pack now works with Sodium and other optimization mods. ( Since 1.19.4 the mod pack is based on the OptiDef mod pack from my friend Defom_kills (DefomCode on Modrinth))

The shader is now finally running smoothly on Iris, which is why it was decided to switch from OptiFabric to Sodium, because now there is Iris support.

Updated mods that were in the old version

Removed mods that should not have been in the old build.

# PS1 graphics shaders ARE NOT MINE, [GitHub shader page](https://github.com/ckosmic/minecraft-psx)
I don't have permission to use it, but I tried to get it - on June 14, I sent a letter to the shader creator where I asked him about permission, it's been more than a month (I'm writing on July 31) and he still hasn't responded.
